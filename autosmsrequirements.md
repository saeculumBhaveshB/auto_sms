# Requirements Document for Auto SMS Permissions Module

## Overview

This document describes the required permissions for an Android application developed using React Native and native Android (Kotlin). The application aims to automatically send SMS messages to callers when the user misses their calls. Permissions should be clearly requested from the user, statuses must be stored locally (Async Storage), and their current status should be displayed on a dedicated screen.

## Required Permissions

### 1. Identify Missed Calls

- **Permission:** READ_CALL_LOG
- **Description:** Allow the application to detect missed calls and identify the caller details.

### 2. Access Phone Call Logs

- **Permission:** READ_CALL_LOG
- **Description:** Necessary to read and analyze call history, particularly missed calls.

### 3. Make and Manage Phone Calls

- **Permission:** CALL_PHONE
- **Description:** Allow the app to initiate or manage phone calls if required by further app logic.

### 4. Auto Reply and Caller Identification

- **Permission:** ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS
- **Description:** Enables automatic response to incoming phone calls and provides caller identification capabilities.

### 5. Access Contacts

- **Permission:** READ_CONTACTS
- **Description:** Required for matching incoming calls with existing contacts and providing personalized messages.

### 6. Send and View SMS Messages

- **Permissions:** SEND_SMS, READ_SMS
- **Description:** Enables the app to automatically send SMS messages and to view existing SMS history to avoid duplicates or manage message threads.

### 7. Notification Interaction

- **Permission:** POST_NOTIFICATIONS
- **Description:** Needed to notify the user whenever the app interacts with callers via SMS or phone calls.

## Local Storage Requirement

All permission statuses must be stored locally using React Native's Async Storage.

### Data Structure

Permissions status should be stored in JSON format:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "READ_CALL_LOG": true,
    "CALL_PHONE": false,
    "ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS": true,
    "READ_CONTACTS": false,
    "SEND_SMS": true,
    "READ_SMS": true,
    "POST_NOTIFICATIONS": true
  }
}
```

## UI Display

### Permissions Status Screen

- Develop a dedicated React Native screen named `PermissionsStatusScreen`.
- Clearly display the list of permissions with their current granted status (Granted/Not Granted).
- Provide visual cues such as green ticks (✓) for granted and red crosses (✗) for not granted.
- Include buttons or toggles allowing users to re-request permissions.

### Permissions Request Flow

- Each permission should clearly inform the user why the permission is needed.
- On permission denial, guide the user to manually enable permissions through the app settings.

## Technical Notes

- Utilize a Kotlin Native Module (`PermissionsManager`) to handle permission requests and status checks.
- React Native should interface with this native module via a clearly defined bridge (`NativeModules`).
- Adhere to best practices regarding permission usage to ensure compliance with Android policy guidelines.

This document should provide sufficient clarity and detail for Cursor AI to generate a well-structured React Native + Native Android permission-handling implementation.
