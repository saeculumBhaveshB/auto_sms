# Phi-3-mini Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Native Layer**

   - Created JNI wrapper for llama.cpp integration (llama_wrapper.h, llama_wrapper.cpp)
   - Set up CMake build configuration for native code
   - Created Phi3MiniModule for React Native bridge
   - Implemented ModelDownloader utility for downloading the model

2. **React Native Layer**

   - Created Phi3MiniTester component for UI interaction
   - Updated LLMTestScreen to include a tab for switching between default LLM and Phi-3-mini
   - Added proper prompt formatting for Phi-3-mini

3. **Registration**
   - Added Phi3MiniPackage to MainApplication.kt
   - Set up proper module initialization

## What Needs to Be Done

1. **Complete llama.cpp Integration**

   - Download and integrate the actual llama.cpp source code
   - Complete the implementation of the JNI methods in llama_wrapper.cpp
   - Add proper memory management and error handling

2. **Model Download**

   - Implement a progress indicator for model download
   - Add checksum verification for downloaded model
   - Consider adding a smaller model option for devices with limited storage

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Add GPU acceleration support where available
   - Optimize memory usage for different device capabilities
   - Implement caching for frequently used prompts/responses

4. **Document Integration**
   - Enhance the retrieval mechanism as described in the document
   - Implement better scoring for document relevance
   - Add support for extracting text from more document formats

## How to Test

1. Build and run the application
2. Navigate to the LLM Testing Tool
3. Switch to the "Phi-3-mini" tab
4. Click "Load Model" - this will download the model if needed
5. Enter a question and click "Generate Answer"
6. The response will be displayed below

## Notes

- The current implementation uses a 4-bit quantized version of Phi-3-mini (2.2GB)
- The model supports a 4K token context window
- Prompt format follows the Phi-3 chat template: `<|user|>\nQuestion<|end|>\n<|assistant|>`
- For document Q&A, we use a system message with document context
