# 🚀 Quick Start: Build AAB for Play Store

## What I Need From You

To create the AAB file for Play Store submission, I need you to:

### 1. 🔐 Create Release Keystore
Run this command and follow the prompts:
```bash
./create_keystore.sh
```

**You'll be asked for:**
- Your name
- Organization name  
- City/Location
- State/Province
- Country code
- Keystore password (remember this!)
- Key password (remember this!)

### 2. ⚙️ Configure Gradle Properties
```bash
cp android/gradle.properties.example android/gradle.properties
```

Then edit `android/gradle.properties` and replace:
- `YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_HERE` with your keystore password
- `YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD_HERE` with your key password

### 3. 📦 Build the AAB File
```bash
./build_aab.sh
```

This will create `auto_sms_release.aab` ready for Play Store upload!

## 📋 What You'll Get

After running these commands, you'll have:
- ✅ `auto_sms_release.aab` - Ready for Play Store upload
- ✅ Release keystore (keep this safe!)
- ✅ Signed app bundle with proper configuration

## 🏪 Play Store Requirements

Your app is ready for Play Store submission with:
- ✅ Professional app icon (blue with phone + AI design)
- ✅ Proper app name: "Missed Call AI"
- ✅ All required permissions properly declared
- ✅ Release build configuration
- ✅ Optimized for Play Store policies

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Keep your keystore safe** - You'll need it for all future app updates
2. **Don't commit passwords** - Keep gradle.properties secure
3. **Test the AAB** - Install and test before submitting
4. **Prepare justification** - For SMS/Call permissions (see PLAY_STORE_CHECKLIST.md)
